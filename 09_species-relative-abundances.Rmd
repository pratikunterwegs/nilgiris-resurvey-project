# Species relative abundances over time

In this script, we calculate species relative abundances over time by replicating a novel approach proposed by Gotelli et al. 2021 (who provides a methodological approach to calculate relative species abundances using historical museum records).

The assumption is that the level of the analysis is at the 'historic-site' and not the 'modern-site' (which essentially corresponds to multiple unique modern survey sites for every 'historic-site'). 

## Load necessary libraries

library(RColorBrewer)
library(extrafont)
library(sf)
library(raster)

# source custom functions
source("code/02_relative-species-abundance-functions.R")
```

## Load list of resurvey locations

We will load the list of sites across which a modern resurvey was carried out, along with elevation rasters.  
```{r}
# load list of resurvey locations and add elevation as a variable
# remove the modern resurvey locations only (ie. ASFQ)
sites <- read.csv("data/list-of-resurvey-locations.csv")
sites <- sites[-c(1:50),]

# convert to sf object and transform
sites <- st_as_sf(sites, coords = c("longitude", "latitude")) %>%
  `st_crs<-`(4326) %>%
  st_transform(32643)

# add elevation raster
alt <- raster::raster("data/spatial/elevation/alt") # this layer is not added to github as a result of its large size and can be downloaded from SRTM (Farr et al. (2007))

# extract values from that raster (note: transformation of coordinate system)
elev <- raster::extract(alt, sites)
sites <- cbind(sites, elev)
```

## For the historical occurrence data, we will choose data from a single time period: 1850-1900
```{r}
## read in historical occurrence data
hist_occ <- read.csv("data/historical-occurrence-data.csv")

## filter data
hist_occ <- hist_occ %>%
  filter(year <= 1901)

# calculate total count of historical data at each site
hist_occ <- hist_occ %>%
  group_by(scientific_name, historical_site_code) %>%
  count() %>%
  summarise("1850-1900" = sum(n)) 

# left join the sites dataframe
hist_occ <- left_join(hist_occ, sites, by=c("historical_site_code"="historical_site_code")) %>%
  filter(!is.na(scientific_name)) %>%
  replace(is.na(.), 0) 

## read in modern occurrence data
mod_occ <- read.csv("data/modern-occurrence-data.csv")

## group by scientific name and modern site code
mod_occ <- mod_occ %>%
  filter(!is.na(historical_site_code)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(scientific_name)) %>%
  group_by(scientific_name, modern_site_code) %>%
  summarise("2021" = sum(number))

## left join the sites dataframe
mod_occ <-  left_join(mod_occ, sites, by=c("modern_site_code"="modern_site_code")) %>%
  filter(!is.na(scientific_name)) %>%
  replace(is.na(.), 0)
```

## Calculate dirichlet distributions of relative abundance

Here, we will functions from Gotelli et al. 2021 to calculate relative species abundances between historic and modern periods.  
```{r}
# note: the level of the analysis is at the 'historic-site' and not the 'modern-site' (which essentially corresponds to two or three unique sites for every 'historic-site')
# to ensure that the analysis is consistent, we sum abundances across the modern sites corresponding to each historic site
# However, our analysis calculates relative species abundances for the give time period rather than by site + time-period

## calculating relative species abundances for the time period 1850-1900

# we remove modern site_code and get only distinct rows
unique_hist <- hist_occ[,c(1,2,3)] %>%
  group_by(scientific_name, historical_site_code) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  group_by(scientific_name) %>%
  summarise("relAbund1850" = sum(`1850-1900`)) 

# we remove modern site_code and get only distinct rows
unique_mod <- mod_occ[,c(1,3,5)] %>%
  group_by(scientific_name, historical_site_code) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  group_by(scientific_name) %>%
  summarise("relAbund2021" = sum(`2021`)) 

hist_mod <- full_join(unique_hist, unique_mod) %>%
  replace_na(list(relAbund1850 = 0, relAbund2021 = 0)) 

## above dataframe suggests that there are 69 species that had historical records/observations, but were not detected in the modern resurvey
## similarly, there are 23 species unique to the modern resurvey that were not recorded/collected in the historical time period

# apply dirichlet distribution to the historical data
dat <- tibble::deframe(hist_mod[,1:2]) ## choosing 1850-1900 data

relAbun1850 <- dirch_stats(dat) %>%
  dplyr::select(species, bayes_mean) %>%
  rename(., bayes_mean_1850 = bayes_mean)

# apply dirichlet distribution to the modern survey
dat <- tibble::deframe(hist_mod[,c(1,3)]) ## choosing modern data

relAbun2021 <- dirch_stats(dat) %>%
  dplyr::select(species, bayes_mean) %>%
  rename(., bayes_mean_2021 = bayes_mean)

### join the relative abundance datasets together
relAbun <- full_join(relAbun1850, relAbun2021, by = c("species")) %>%
  #replace(is.na(.), 0) %>%

## Examining changes in relative abundance as a function of species habitat affiliation
```{r}
## load in species trait dataset
trait_dat <- read.csv("data/species-trait-dat.csv")

# note: the classification of habitat type was created by comparing habitat affiliation data from the State of India's Birds report (v2; released in 2023). We used the following trait classifications:
# Forest 
# Grassland 
# Wooded Habitat
# Generalist

# Our criteria for each of these classifications includes the following: # In the 1850s, the land cover change analysis revealed that the majority of the landscape was largely grasslands and forests. However in 2018, the landscape is largely a mosaic of human-modified land cover types - including wooded habitats (mostly comprising timber plantations and degraded forests), tea plantations, followed by forests and grasslands.
# While the State of India's Birds provides a habitat classification/criteria based on contemporary use of habitats by a species, we classified species based on our resurveys and assuming that a species would either be in a forest, grassland, wooded habitat or a generalist species in the 1850s. 
# An example in this case is the black and orange flycatcher. While it is commonly found in shola forest habitat, this species is also common in degraded wooded areas, including timber plantations. However, in the 1850s (due to limited presence of timber plantations compared to 2018), we assume that this is a forest specialist bird. 
# Other examples include bird species that prefer open habitats, scrubland and dry grassland - such species have been lumped into the Grassland category as this was the closest habitat similar to the above habitat types in 1850s. Eg. Blue-tailed bee-eater, long-tailed shrike, black-winged kite. 
# If a species is truly a generalist species and is not particularly occupying/specialized on any particular wooded/forested/grassland habitat, it was classified in the generalist category
# Based on the above crtiera, 84 species were classified as forest birds, 33 species were classified as grassland birds, 31 species were classified as generalist species and 19 species were classified as wooded habitat species.

# We fitted a logistic mixed model (estimated using ML and nlminb optimizer)
# to predict relative_abundance with time_period (formula: relative_abundance
# ~ time_period). The model included scientific_name as random effect
# (formula: ~1 | scientific_name). The model's explanatory power related to
# the fixed effects alone (marginal R2) is 1.07e-03. The model's intercept,
# corresponding to time_period = 1850-1900, is at -4.85 (95% CI [-5.24,
# -4.46], p < .001). Within this model:
