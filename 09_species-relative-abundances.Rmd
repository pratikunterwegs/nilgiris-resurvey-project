### Species relative abundances over time

We replicate analyses following Gotelli et al. 2021 (who provides a methodological approach to calculate relative species abundances using historical museum records) and GÃ³mez et al. 2021 who assumed two scenarios while calculating extinctions and colonizations - "The first is based on the assumption that all surveys accurately describe the avifauna present and that any records of species not detected in prior surveys of San Antonio represent real colonizations. The second scenario is based on the assumption that all the novel species (i.e., those detected for the first time after the 1910s) were false absences."

The second assumption is that the level of the analysis is at the 'historic-site' and not the 'modern-site' (which essentially corresponds to multiple unique modern survey sites for every 'historic-site'). While calculating relative abundances and for estimation of turnover and to ensure that the analysis is consistent, we sum abundances across the modern sites corresponding to each historic site.  

### Load necessary libraries
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(tidyverse)
library(scico)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(extrafont)
library(sf)
library(raster)
library(data.table)
library(ggrepel)
library(report)
library(lme4)
library(multcomp)

# source custom functions
source("code/02_relative-species-abundance-functions.R")
```

### Load list of resurvey locations

We will load the list of sites across which a modern resurvey was carried out, along with elevation rasters.  
```{r}
# load list of resurvey locations and add elevation as a variable
# remove the modern resurvey locations only (ie. ASFQ)
sites <- read.csv("data/list-of-resurvey-locations.csv")
sites <- sites[-c(1:50),]

# convert to sf object and transform
sites <- st_as_sf(sites, coords = c("longitude", "latitude")) %>%
  `st_crs<-`(4326) %>%
  st_transform(32643)

# add elevation raster
alt <- raster("data/spatial/elevation/alt") # this layer is not added to github as a result of its large size and can be downloaded from SRTM (Farr et al. (2007))

# extract values from that raster (note: transformation of coordinate system)
elev <- extract(alt, sites)
sites <- cbind(sites, elev)
```


For the historical occurrence data, we will choose data from three time periods: 1850-1900, 1900-1950 and 1950-2000. 
```{r}
## read in historical occurrence data

### Calculate dirichlet distributions of relative abundance

Here, we will functions from Gotelli et al. 2021 to calculate relative species abundances between historic and modern periods. For the first level of analysis, we ignore information at the site-level and calculate overall relative abundance per time-period at the landscape level. 
```{r}
# note: the level of the analysis is at the 'historic-site' and not the 'modern-site' (which essentially corresponds to three unique sites for every 'historic-site')
# to ensure that the analysis is consistent, we sum abundances across the modern sites corresponding to each historic site
# However, our analysis calculates relative species abundances for the give time period rather than by site + time-period

## calculating relative species abundances for the time period 1850-1900

# we remove modern site_code and get only distinct rows
unique_hist_pre1900 <- hist_occ_sites_pre1900[,c(1,3)] %>%

# apply dirichlet distribution

  dplyr::select(species, bayes_mean) %>%
  rename(., bayes_mean_1850 = bayes_mean)

## calculating relative species abundances for the time period 1900-1950

  rename(., bayes_mean_1900 = bayes_mean)

# we remove modern site_code and get only distinct rows
unique_mod <- mod_occ_sites[,c(1,3)] %>%
  group_by(scientific_name) %>%
  summarise("relAbund2021" = sum(`2021`)) 

# apply dirichlet distribution

relAbun2021 <- dirch_stats(dat) %>%
  dplyr::select(species, bayes_mean) %>%

### join the relative abundance datasets together

## Examining changes in relative abundance as a function of species habitat affiliation

#### Let's first curate the species trait data
```{r}
## load state of India's birds data to get habitat affiliation
species_codes <- read.csv("data/species-codes.csv")
habitat_SoIB <- read.csv("data/SoIB-data.csv") # note: we used two files - one file from 2020 and an updated habitat specialization file from 2022 (see below)

# join the two dataframes
habitat_dat <- left_join(species_codes, habitat_SoIB, by=c("scientific_name"="scientific_name"))

# write the above to data folder and recode habitat affiliation
# write.csv(habitat_dat, "data/species-trait-dat.csv", row.names = F)

# note: the classification of habitat type was taken from a working file of trait data for State of India's Birds report v2 (to be released in 2023). We used the following trait classifications:
# Wooded habitat: If it preferred some level of wooded habitat but not particularly specialized on rainforest/forest habitat. An example in this case is the black and orange flycatcher. While it is commonly found in shola forest habitat, this species is also common in degraded wooded areas, including timber plantations. If a species preferred just scrub habitat alone, we lumped it under this category.
# Forest: If a species was a forest specialist. 
# Grassland: While State of India's birds uses a separate classification for grassland & grassland+scrub, here we combine the two and use a single classification for Grassland. Eg. Black drongo - which favors both grassland areas and scrub habitat. There are four species that are classified as using 'open habitat' which had been subsumed under grasslands in our study - this includes - blue-tailed bee-eater, black-winged kite, long-tailed shrike (eBird lists it as preferring open habitats) and western yellow wagtail. 
# Generalist: If a species is truly a generalist species and is not particularly occupying/specialized on any particular wooded/forested/grassland habitat.

## load the species trait data (that includes habitat) and merge with the AVONET dataset
## please note that it is being loaded after curating and adding a column for habitat type based on our understanding of species natural history
